# haxeui-luxe
`haxeui-luxe` is the `luxe` backend for HaxeUI.

## Installation
 * `haxeui-luxe` has a dependency to <a href="https://github.com/haxeui/haxeui-core">`haxeui-core`</a>, and so that too must be installed.
 * `haxeui-luxe` also has a dependency to <a href="http://luxeengine.com/docs/index.html">luxe</a>, please refer to the installation instructions on their <a href="http://luxeengine.com/docs/index.html">site</a>.

Eventually all these libs will become haxelibs, however, currently in their alpha form they do not even contain a `haxelib.json` file (for dependencies, etc) and therefore can only be used by downloading the source and using the `haxelib dev` command or by directly using the git versions using the `haxelib git` command (recommended). Eg:

```
haxelib git haxeui-core https://github.com/haxeui/haxeui-core
haxelib dev haxeui-luxe path/to/expanded/source/archive
```

## Usage
The simplest method to create a new `luxe` application that is HaxeUI ready is to use one of the <a href="https://github.com/haxeui/haxeui-templates">haxeui-templates</a>. These templates will allow you to start a new project rapidly with HaxeUI support baked in. 

If however you already have an existing application, then incorporating HaxeUI into that application is straightforward:

## project.flow
Simply add the following dependencies to your `project.flow`:

```js
"hscript":      "*",
"haxeui-core":  "*",
"haxeui-luxe":  "*"
```

Your `project.flow` should end up looking something like the following:

```js
{
	...
    "build": {
      "dependencies": {
        "luxe":         "*",
        "hscript":      "*",
        "haxeui-core":  "*",
        "haxeui-luxe":  "*"
      }
    },
	...
  }
}
```

_Note: its important to surround the dependencies `haxeui-core` and `haxeui-luxe` with double quotes (`"`) since they contain a hypen._

### Toolkit initialisation and usage
Initialising the toolkit requires you to add this single line somewhere _before_ you start to actually use HaxeUI in your application, but _after_ the `luxe` application has been initialised - for example in the `ready` function. Eg:

```haxe
class Main extends luxe.Game {
	public override function ready() {
		Toolkit.init();
	}
}
```
